# Day 02 – Arrays (Basics)

## 🔹 What is an Array?

An **array** is a collection of elements of the **same data type** stored in **continuous (contiguous) memory locations**.

- Each element is accessed using an **index**
- In Java, indexing starts from **0**
- Size of an array is **fixed**

### Example (Java)
```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};

---

## 🔹 Key Characteristics of an Array
- Fixed size
- Stores elements of the same data type
- Fast access to elements
- Index-based data structure
- Stored in contiguous memory locations

---

## 🔹 How is an Array Stored in Memory?

Arrays are stored in **contiguous memory locations**, meaning all elements are placed next to each other in memory.

### Example
```java
int[] arr = {5, 10, 15};

## 🧠 Memory Representation of an Array

Assume:
- Data type: `int`
- Size of `int` = **4 bytes**
- Base address of array = **1000**

| Index | Address | Value |
|------|--------|------|
| 0 | 1000 | 5 |
| 1 | 1004 | 10 |
| 2 | 1008 | 15 |

➡ Each element is stored **4 bytes apart** because an `int` occupies 4 bytes.

---

# How is an Array Accessed?

Arrays are accessed using an **index**.  
Each index directly maps to a memory location.

---

## 📐 Address Calculation Formula (Important for Interviews)


- `Base_Address` → address of the first element (`arr[0]`)
- `i` → index of the element
- `size_of_data_type` → memory size of one element (e.g., 4 bytes for `int`)

👉 Because of this direct calculation, **array access takes constant time**.

## 🔹 Example (Java)

```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};
int x = arr[2];   // Direct access
